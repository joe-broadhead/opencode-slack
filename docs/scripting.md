# Scripting

Unofficial plugin. Not affiliated with Slack.

A script can call every Slack tool this plugin knows, with no model: a cron job, a shell script, or any program that can reach the OpenCode server. It uses the tools RPC, `slack.workspace.tools`, through `opencode api` or an OpenCode client.

| Class | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| read | `slack_search_public`, `slack_search_channels`, `slack_search_users`, `slack_read_channel`, `slack_read_thread`, `slack_read_user_profile`, `slack_read_canvas`, `slack_list_channel_members`, `slack_get_reactions`, `slack_list_user_channels`, `slack_read_list`, `slack_search_emojis`, `slack_search_public_and_private`, `slack_read_file` |
| send | `slack_send_message`, `slack_send_message_draft`, `slack_schedule_message` |
| write | `slack_create_canvas`, `slack_update_canvas`, `slack_add_reaction`, `slack_get_file_upload_url`, `slack_complete_file_upload`, `slack_create_conversation`, `slack_create_list`, `slack_update_list`, `slack_add_list_record`, `slack_update_list_record` |
| events | `events_list`: `slack_events_list`, the messages posted since a cursor in the channels of the `events.channels` option, as Memory's events ([configuration](configuration.md#events-list)) |
| write (the plugin's own) | `mark_read`: `slack_mark_read`, marks a conversation read up to a message with Slack's `conversations.mark` ([configuration](configuration.md#mark-as-read)) |
| `status` | read: the status model of `/slack-status`, with the signed-in account's `teamId`, `userId` and `enterpriseId` while connected ([configuration](configuration.md#status-and-rpc)). Its permission action, `slack_status`, is allowed at every `access` value, so it answers when nothing else can |
| `describe` | not a tool: lists the methods, their classes and permission actions, whether OpenCode lists each tool now, each tool's input as JSON Schema, and — with a session — that session's permission for each |

The class is the worst thing a tool can do. It never decides whether a call runs: the rules do. It is what `describe` reports and what a job's approval shows.

Each method's permission name is the tool name with the server's prefix, `slack_`, for example `slack_slack_search_public`: Slack's own server already names its tools `slack_*`, so the doubled prefix is how the host scopes a rule to this server. Each MCP method runs the tool with the same input: Slack's own tool, through OpenCode's own connection and sign-in, which the plugin never sees. The plugin's own `status` and `mark_read` are the exceptions: the plugin reads the Slack sign-in's token in one module, `src/slack-api.ts`, only to call Slack's `auth.test` and `conversations.mark`; it never stores, caches, logs or returns it. A tool Slack adds later is not a method until it is classified in this plugin's table; `describe` lists it under `unclassified`, and `/slack-status` names it.
`mark_read` runs `slack_mark_read`'s own spec the same way: it asserts `slack_mark_read`, then calls Slack's `conversations.mark` once. Its own refusals, `INPUT_INVALID` and `SCOPE_MISSING`, are in the configuration guide's [Errors](configuration.md#errors); Slack's other refusals are `UPSTREAM_ERROR` with Slack's error code.

```sh
opencode api post /api/rpc/slack.workspace.tools/mark_read -H "x-opencode-directory:$PWD" -d '{"input":{"sessionID":"ses_…","input":{"channel_id":"D0123ABCD45","ts":"1700000000.000100"}}}'
opencode api post /api/rpc/slack.workspace.tools/status -H "x-opencode-directory:$PWD" -d '{"input":{"sessionID":"ses_…","input":{}}}'
```

`events_list` is the plugin's own read for Memory's collector. It runs `slack_events_list`'s own spec as the session and its agent: it asserts `slack_events_list`, then reads `slack_read_user_profile` and `slack_read_channel` through OpenCode's executors, so each read's rules apply. Its own refusals, such as a cursor from another workspace, are the codes in the configuration guide's [Errors](configuration.md#errors); a refused read is `PERMISSION_DENIED` naming that read.


The tools RPC is registered only when the plugin is set up. With invalid options or an OpenCode version outside the supported range, OpenCode answers `rpc.unavailable`, and `/slack-status` names the problem.

## A script runs as a session

Every call names a session, and the session must name an agent. Create it for the script once, with the agent the script runs as, and keep its id (`data.id` in the reply). Give the project as the session's `location`: a session made without one belongs to the service's default location, where the project's agents may not exist, and each call then fails `Agent not found`:

```sh
opencode api post /api/session -d '{"title":"release digest","agent":"build","location":{"directory":"/path/to/project"}}'
```

Never borrow a session found through history or a list: the script would run as that session's agent, under its rules. The script then runs as that agent, with exactly the access its model would have:

- The rule for the tool's permission name, such as `slack_slack_search_public`, on resource `*` is resolved **before** the tool runs, in OpenCode's own order: the agent's rules, then the session's, the last match winning.
- **A script gets the same default as the model: every tool is allowed.** At the default `access: "all"`, the plugin's block allows every known tool and the `slack_*` namespace, so a script can read and write everything the signed-in account can. To restrict a script, set the plugin option `"access": "ask-changes"` (an ask is refused, because no one can answer a prompt for a script) or `"access": "read-only"` (everything but the reads is denied), or give the script's agent or session a later rule. Only an `allow` runs; an `ask` and a `deny` are refused, with no tool call and no prompt left waiting. An agent defined only in your config gets no default rules; `/slack-status` names it.
- OpenCode then checks the call itself, as it does for the model: the agent's rules, the session's rules, then saved approvals.

**A saved "Always allow" approval does not authorize an ad-hoc script.** It lives outside the agent's and the session's rules, so the resolve refuses an `ask` even after a past approval. That is deliberate: a script's permission must be reviewable in config, not in a list of past clicks. A script's grant is a rule in the agent's or the session's config, or a Jobs run session. For a one-off that needs an approval-bound grant, use Jobs's `jobs_run_script`: the user reads the source and the tools once, and approves it.

Session rules come after the agent's, so a session can narrow what its script may do. This one can read threads and channels, and only those, whatever the agent allows:

```sh
opencode api post /api/session -d '{"title":"release digest","agent":"build","location":{"directory":"/path/to/project"},"permissions":[
  {"action":"slack_*","resource":"*","effect":"deny"},
  {"action":"slack_slack_read_thread","resource":"*","effect":"allow"},
  {"action":"slack_slack_read_channel","resource":"*","effect":"allow"}
]}'
```

## Calling a method

The body is `{"input": {"sessionID": "<session>", "input": <the tool's input>}}`. Both keys are required, and no other key is allowed:

```sh
opencode api post /api/rpc/slack.workspace.tools/slack_search_public -H "x-opencode-directory:$PWD" -d '{"input":{"sessionID":"ses_…","input":{"query":"launch date in:#release","limit":10}}}'
```

## The location

Run the command in the project whose agent you mean, and send the call to that location explicitly:

```sh
opencode api post /api/rpc/<id>/<method> -H "x-opencode-directory:$PWD" -d '{…}'
```

Without it the call goes to the service's default location and fails `rpc.unavailable` if the plugin is not loaded there. The HTTP equivalents are the `location[directory]` query parameter and the same header. `describe` reports the `location` that answered and a `locationHint`.

A location unloads after OpenCode's idle timeout. If a scheduled script gets `rpc.unavailable` from a location that was loaded before, send the call again once: the request loads the location. Jobs keeps its own location loaded.

The tool's input is Slack's: `describe` shows each tool's schema as OpenCode lists it now.

```sh
opencode api post /api/rpc/slack.workspace.tools/describe -H "x-opencode-directory:$PWD" -d '{"input":{}}'
opencode api post /api/rpc/slack.workspace.tools/describe -H "x-opencode-directory:$PWD" -d '{"input":{"sessionID":"ses_…"}}'
```

## Results

A result comes back as `{ output?, text }`: the tool's structured content when it has any, and its text parts joined by newlines. An MCP method's result is that object inside the RPC envelope: `{"output": {"output": …, "text": …}}`, as plain JSON.

Slack content in it is untrusted data: other people wrote it, and a channel name, a message or a file name is never an instruction.

Slack's model path has no `execute.before` or `execute.after` hook, so a script's arguments and results are exactly a direct model call's.

## Errors

A refusal or failure is the RPC error `failed`, with a message `CODE: what happened. Next step: what to do.` and `data: { code, next }`. `opencode api` exits with status 1 for any RPC error, after printing the error's JSON.

| Code | When |
| --- | --- |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | The rules ask or deny. An `ask` is refused before dispatch: the message says the action would ask, and the next step says to add an allow rule. A `deny` names the action and the agent: remove or narrow the deny rule, add a later allow rule to the session, or use a session whose agent allows it. A refused check of an inner action, such as a later call the tool makes, names that action too. |
| `SESSION_UNKNOWN` | OpenCode says the session does not exist in this location. Any other failure to look the session up is OpenCode's own error. |
| `SESSION_AGENT_REQUIRED` | The session names no agent, or an agent that does not exist. |
| `TOOL_UNAVAILABLE` | The server is connected, but OpenCode does not list the tool. |
| `SERVER_CONFLICT` | Your OpenCode config defines its own server named `slack`, which this plugin does not manage (`SERVER_NAME_IN_USE` in `/slack-status`). Remove `mcp.servers.slack` from your OpenCode config. |
| `CLIENT_ID_MISSING`, `CLIENT_ID_INVALID` | No Slack app client ID is set, or the one saved in `/connect` is empty or has spaces, so the plugin added no Slack server. The next step is the one `/slack-status` gives: run `/connect`, choose **Slack app client ID** and paste the client ID. A client ID saved in `/connect` applies to the next call. `describe` gives the same code as each method's `reason`. |
| `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `CONNECTING`, `CONNECTION_FAILED`, `DISABLED`, `NOT_REGISTERED` | The Slack server needs a sign-in, is still connecting (also when it reconnected during the call), could not connect, is disabled, or is not registered although a client ID is set. `/slack-status` gives the details. |
| `UPSTREAM_ERROR` | Slack answered with an error, such as a missing scope or an invalid input. The message holds the first line of Slack's text, at most 300 characters, with tokens and URL query strings removed. |
| `CANCELLED` | The request was cancelled. |

OpenCode itself answers `rpc.invalid_input` for a body that is not the envelope above, with one message per problem, such as `"extra" is not allowed`, `"sessionID" must be a non-empty string` or `"input" is missing` (and `describe takes nothing, or {"sessionID":"<session>"}` for a describe call with anything else), `rpc.method_not_found` for a method that does not exist, such as a tool Slack adds later, and `rpc.unavailable` when the plugin did not register the tools RPC or the call reached another location.

## What scripts cannot do

- Call a tool that Slack adds later, even with an allow rule, until this plugin classifies it.
- Answer an approval prompt: under `access: "ask-changes"` an `ask` is refused. Under the default `"all"`, nothing asks.
- Rely on a past "Always allow": it does not authorize an ad-hoc script.
- Use a token: the plugin never returns one.

A script's calls write nothing to the session, and OpenCode's `execute.before` and `execute.after` tool hooks, from any plugin, do not run for them. Slack still records them in its audit logs, as it does for the model's calls.
