## [0.0.0] - 2026-11-01

### Added

- Slack's hosted MCP server, `https://mcp.slack.com/mcp`, registered as the MCP server `slack` with your Slack app's OAuth client. OpenCode signs in with PKCE and refreshes the token.
- Sign-in from `/connect`: **Slack app** stores the app's client ID (and an optional client secret) in OpenCode's credential store, and **Slack** signs in. A change to the stored client applies without a restart.
- Options: `oauth.client_id` (pins the client, for example in an organisation's managed config), `oauth.redirect_uri` (default `http://localhost:8765/callback`), `oauth.scopes` (default `channels:history channels:read search:read.public users:read`), `oauth.client_secret` through `{env:NAME}`, `server` and `allowUntestedHost`.
- Default permissions: the known read tools run without asking. Private search, file reads, writes (messages, drafts, schedules, reactions, canvases, lists, new conversations and file uploads) and unknown tools ask. Your `permissions` rules and "Always allow" answers override them.
- `/slack-status`, the TUI dialog **Slack: Status** (`/slack`) and the status RPC, sharing one status model: the state, an error code, the client and its source, the tools by class, the agents without the default rules, the host check and one next step.
- A host check: on an OpenCode version outside `>=2.2.3 <2.3.0`, only the status surfaces are registered unless `allowUntestedHost` is `true`.
- The `slack-search` skill: search with `keywords` and `natural_language_query`, read for context, cite permalinks, and treat Slack content as untrusted.
- A Slack app manifest, `docs/slack-app-manifest.json`.
